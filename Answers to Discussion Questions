Recursion   
    1. Recursion is when a function is called on itself within the function. Any loop can be written instead as a recursion and any recursion can be written instead with a loop. Recursion can be very memory intensive.
    2. It is necessary to have a Base Case to stop the function from calling itself at some point. 

Graphs:
    1. A graph is like a tree, but graphs can have loops or cycles. Relationships in graphs can be directed or non-directed. Graphs have a node as the basic uing andedges connecting nodes. 
    2. A graph has loops whereas a tree does not have loops, just linked lists.
    3. A good model for a graph may be a chart of your friends and who their frieds are with mutual friends connecting back to you.

Fill in the runtimes for the following actions for the table below:

Data Structure         Index   Search  Add-R   Add-L   Pop-L   Pop-R
Python List (Array)     O(1)    O(n)    O(1)    O(n)    O(n)    O(1)  
Linked List             O(n)    O(n)    O(1)    O(1)    O(1)    O(n)
Doubly-Linked List      O(n)    O(n)    O(1)    O(1)    O(1)    O(1)   
Queue (as Array)        X        X      O(1)     X      O(n)     X
Queue (as LL or DLL)    X        X      O(1)     X      O(1)     X
Stack (as Array, LL,    X        X      O(1)     X       X      O(1)
Deque (as DLL)          X        X      O(1)    O(1)    O(1)    O(1) 

Index: Find an item in the structure when you know its position
Search: Find an item in the structure when you know its data
Add(R/L): Set a key in set/dictionary or add node to tree
Pop(R/L): Remove a key or node

Sorting:
1. The Bubble Sort is when you compare each item in the list to the item next to it. You sort those two items. The largest of the two items are placed at the higher index of the two indexes you're looking at.  Now, sort between that item(at the higher index) and the next item, moving the largest item to the next index position. After one iteration, the bubble sort will end up with the largest value at the end of the list. You need to go over the list again to get  the second largest item in the second to last position, and so on. Bubble sort runs in O(n**2)
2. Merge sort is when you make every item in your list it's own list of one. Then, you sort the lists of one together into sorted lists of two. Then you sort two lists of two together into a sorted list of four, etc....it runs in O(nlogn ) time
3. A Quick Sort is when you choose a pivot point and move all the items in the list to the right or left of that point. Then you sort each half of the list (on either side of the pivot using another pivot). This also has a O(nlogn) runtime.

Git Branching
1. Git Branching is used when you want to change a program but want to make the changes
on a developement version of the program, not on the version that's live and actively running right now, first to make sure the changes are what you want them to be. After you make the changes to the development version, you merge that version into the live version.
2. A pull request is when you do some work on a file that's not your own. You make a pull request to github so the owner of the file can review your work and merge your changes if the owner thinks they are worth making.
